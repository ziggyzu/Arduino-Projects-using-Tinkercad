Ultrasonic  Sensor
An ultrasonic sonar sensor is a device that uses ultrasonic sound waves to detect objects and measure distances. It works by emitting a high-frequency sound pulse (usually above 20 kHz, which is beyond human hearing), and then measuring the time it takes for the echo to return after bouncing off an object.

Working principle

Transmit: The sensor sends out an ultrasonic sound wave.

Travel: The sound wave travels through the air until it hits an object.

Echo: The wave reflects back to the sensor.

Receive & Calculate: The sensor detects the returning echo and calculates the distance based on the time delay.

Applications:

Obstacle avoidance in robots

Parking sensors in cars

Liquid level sensing

Security systems
